# ðŸ“Š Business Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio!  
This repository features a collection of projects I developed during my academic journey and professional exploration in business analytics. Here youâ€™ll find code, analysis, and queries from independent work as well as collaborative team initiatives. My goal is to turn data into meaningful insights and practical solutionsâ€”whether for supply chain, finance, operations, or beyond.
