# 📊 Business Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio!  
This repository features a collection of projects I developed during my academic journey and professional exploration in business analytics. Here you’ll find code, analysis, and queries from independent work as well as collaborative team initiatives. My goal is to turn data into meaningful insights and practical solutions—whether for supply chain, finance, operations, or beyond.
